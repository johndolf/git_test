Hello world my life still isn't great. I'm still anxious all the time, I feel it in my stomach everyday. Some of it at the moment is about one of the girls at the gym I look at now and again. I
probably look like a creep looking at her and everyone else, but her in particular because I remember her when she was around 16. I never really thought anything of it at the time because she
was 16 in my head there was nothing wrong with looking. Thinking about it now isn't helping my OCD. I keep thinking her and her bf are going to tell people I'm a peodofile or something. I keep
having thoughts of getting into confrontations with her bf about me looking at her now and back then. I don't know anymore.
